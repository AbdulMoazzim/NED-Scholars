        content: "I am Syed Muhammad Daniyal Azam, an Electrical Engineering graduate from NED University, Batch 2022. My journey is a testament to how hard work and the right support can transform lives. Coming from a lower-middle-class family, my parents prioritized my education despite financial constraints. To contribute, I began tutoring, which ultimately led me to NED University. However, rising costs forced me to take on more work, impacting my studies and CGPA. Worried about securing a scholarship, I found hope through the mentorship of NED Scholars, especially Dr. Sohail and Umaid. Their support not only eased my financial burden but also connected me with a community facing similar challenges, fostering my personal and professional growth. With their encouragement, I launched a successful freelancing career, earning around $60,000 while helping my friends and cousins achieve financial independence. As my classmates sought jobs, I had already built connections in the US, even forming a team to expand my work. My journey included traveling across Europe and overcoming challenges, such as a 15-day period without stable housing. Yet, the motivation from my mentors kept me focused on my goals. Receiving a laptop from NED Scholars was a pivotal moment that enabled my freelancing venture. Today, I am financially stable and plan to start my own company. I owe my gratitude to NED Scholars for their invaluable support, which has empowered me to build confidence and strive for a brighter future. Now, I am committed to giving back and helping others in need.",

        content: "I am currently doing my PhD in carbon composite material health monitoring at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. My journey started at NED University, where I worked closely with Dr. Sohail. It was with his support that I first got interested in research and began preparing for my PhD. In my third year at NED, I started reading about carbon composites and realized that there was a lot of funding available for this research. By the seventh semester, I had reached out to universities through email and LinkedIn, including places like the University of New South Wales in Australia and Stockholm University. These connections helped me in my research, and today I have a LinkedIn network of 25,000 followers, which has been very useful. I am now part of the Aero-Electrical Research team at the Rolls Royce-UTC University Technology Center, and I also work with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which is one of the main technology research centers in the UK. Although I am still working on finding the exact research gap and preparing to defend my topic, I am determined to keep moving forward. The strong foundation I built at NED University and the support I received from mentors like Dr. Sohail have played a big role in my success. I believe that with continued hard work, I will be able to make important contributions to the field of carbon composite materials.",
